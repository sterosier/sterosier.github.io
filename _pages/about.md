My name is Stéphane Térosier. I am a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at the [Leiden University Centre for Linguistics](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/humanities/leiden-university-centre-for-linguistics). **My main research interests include the syntax of creole languages, especially Martinican creole (of which I am a native speaker). I am also interested in the syntactic and sociolinguistics effects of the contact between a creole and its lexifier. More generally, my research focuses on syntax and the syntax-semantics and syntax-pragmatics interfaces.**

## About creoles

My view of creoles is that, leaving aside the conditions of their emergence, creoles are not fundamentally different from other natural languages. This doesn't mean, however, that they are of no interest. Quite the contray! I believe that they offer unique insights into certain aspects of language. For example, **the process of feature recombination which underlies regular processes of acquisition is simply magnified in the case of creoles due to the greater range of diversity in the input. Creole languages are also subject to a great deal of internal variation, which makes them prime objects for the study of microvariation.**

Creoles are also often in contact with the European languages from which they borrowed the bulk of their lexicon. A consequence of this is that they are sometimes viewed as lesser varieties of their lexifiers. The unfortunate effect of this hierarchy is the stigmatization of creole speakers. Even worse is the fact that creole speakers themselves will sometimes look down on their native languages as if they weren't full-fledged languages.

My hope, therefore, is that my contribution to the study of creole languages will help rehabilitate them in the eyes of their speakers.
