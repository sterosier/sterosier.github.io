My name is Stéphane Térosier. I am a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at the Leiden University Centre for Linguistic. My main research interests include the syntax creole languages and Martinican Creole in particular. While I do not adhere to the view that creoles are fundamentally different from other natural languages, I believe that they offer unique insights into certain aspects of language. The process of feature recombination which underlies regular processes of acquisition is simply magnified in the case of creoles because of the greater range of diversity in the input. As a result of this historical process, creole languages are subject to a great deal of internal variation, which makes them prime objects for the study of microvariation.

Beyond that, although I do not claim to be an expert, I am also interested in the sociolinguistics of creole-speaking communities. Creoles are often in contact with the European languages from which they borrowed the bulk of their lexicon. As a consequence, they are sometimes viewed as lesser varieties of their lexifiers. The unfortunate effect of this hierarchy is the stigmatization of creole speakers. Even worse is the fact that creole speakers themselves will sometimes look down on their native languages as if they weren't full-fledged languages.

Therefore, the study of creole languages cannot be just another academic pursuit. It is the duty of scholars interested in these languages that they contribute ot their rehabilitation in the eyes of their speakers. At the very, this is one of my aspirations.
