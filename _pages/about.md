My name is Stéphane Térosier. I am a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at the [Leiden University Centre for Linguistics](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/humanities/leiden-university-centre-for-linguistics). My main research interests include the syntax of creole languages in general and Martinican Creole in particular. While I do not adhere to the view that creoles are fundamentally different from other natural languages, I believe that they offer unique insights into certain aspects of language. For example, the process of feature recombination which underlies regular processes of acquisition is simply magnified in the case of creoles due to the greater range of diversity in the input. Creole languages are also subject to a great deal of internal variation, which makes them prime objects for the study of microvariation.

Beyond that, although I do not claim to be an expert, I am also interested in the sociolinguistics of creole languages. Creoles are often in contact with the European languages from which they borrowed the bulk of their lexicon. A consequence of this is that they are sometimes viewed as lesser varieties of their lexifiers. The unfortunate effect of this hierarchy is the stigmatization of creole speakers. Even worse is the fact that creole speakers themselves will sometimes look down on their native languages as if they weren't full-fledged languages.

My hope, therefore, is that my contribution to the study of creole languages will help rehabilitate them in the eyes of their speakers.
