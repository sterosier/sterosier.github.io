I have taught several undegraduate courses at the Linguistics department of Université de Montréal while completing my PhD. These include the following courses:
- *Introduction to French syntax*
- *Advanced syntax*
- *Introduction to French morphology*

This semester in Leiden, I taught the *Introduction to French syntax* course to students in the French BA program. Next semester, I'll be teaching various classes including an introductory course to French morphology in addition to language courses (*Grammaire et vocabulaire*) and a couple courses on Francophonie.
